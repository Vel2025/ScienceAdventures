Name: Welcome to Science Fun!!!

Description:

This is a simple three-page website created for SBA 307. The pages includes a home page, experiment page and a contact page.

Reflection Question:
What could you have done differently:
I should have wireframed with all details including the use of other features like use of bootstrap and other animations. This would have made easier while designing.
